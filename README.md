> A personal operating system that makes you the CEO of your life.

**Current Status**: Phase 4 Preparation — Tier-3 Authorized

## What is LifeOS?

LifeOS exists to extend your operational reach into the world. It converts intent into action, thought into artifact, and direction into execution.

Its purpose is to **augment and amplify human agency and judgment**, not originate intent.

## Architecture

LifeOS operates on a three-layer model:

| Layer | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **CEO** | Intent | Defines identity, values, priorities, direction |
| **COO** | Operations | Converts intent into missions, manages agents |
| **Workers** | Execution | Perform bounded, deterministic tasks |

## Core Principles

1. **CEO Supremacy** — The human is the sole source of strategic intent
2. **Audit Completeness** — All actions are logged and traceable
3. **Reversibility** — State is versioned; any action can be undone
4. **Transparency** — Reasoning is visible and auditable
