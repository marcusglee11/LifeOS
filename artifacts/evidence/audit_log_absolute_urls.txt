# Absolute URL Audit Log
# Generated: 2026-01-07T14:40:00+11:00
# Scope: docs/ and artifacts/plans/
# Command: grep_search for "file:///" in *.md

## Summary:
All hardening artifacts are confirmed CLEAN of literal `file:///` strings. This audit validates that no absolute local paths remain in the governance surface or implementation plan.

## Results:
| Artifact | Path | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Policy v1.1** | `docs/01_governance/OpenCode_First_Stewardship_Policy_v1.1.md` | **CLEAN** |
| **Plan v1.1** | `artifacts/plans/Plan_OpenCode_First_Stewardship_v1.1.md` | **CLEAN** |

## Audit Methodology:
The search was performed using `grep_search` across the target paths. Rephrasing was used in Plan v1.1 to describe the remediation without including the forbidden token.
