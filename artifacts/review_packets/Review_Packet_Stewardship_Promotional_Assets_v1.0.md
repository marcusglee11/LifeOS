# Review Packet: Stewardship Promotional Assets v1.0

## Summary
Successfully stewarded the new promotional assets by moving them to a canonical documentation location and updating the project index and strategic corpus.

## Issue Catalogue
- **I1**: New promotional assets added to root (`promotional_assets/`).
- **I2**: `07_productisation` directory was only listed as "Other" in `INDEX.md`.

## Proposed Resolutions
- Moved `An_OS_for_Life.mp4` to `docs/07_productisation/assets/`.
- Promoted `07_productisation` to a formal section in `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Updated `docs/INDEX.md` timestamp.
- Regenerated `docs/LifeOS_Strategic_Corpus.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Assets moved to `docs/07_productisation/assets/`
- [x] `INDEX.md` updated with link and timestamp
- [x] `LifeOS_Strategic_Corpus.md` regenerated
- [x] `LIFEOS_STATE.md` updated
