# Review Packet: Phase 2 Capability Evidence Bundling

**Mode**: Lightweight Stewardship
**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Files Changed/Created**: 5

## Summary
Bundled cryptographic evidence and source code confirming the stubbed status of Phase 2 primitives (`llm_call`, `tool_invoke`, `gate_check`). This bundle serves as the baseline for the Phase 3 un-stubbing effort.
