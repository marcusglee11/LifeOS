# Review Packet: EOL Clean Invariant Hardening v2.1 (Closure-Grade)

**Mode**: Standard  
**Date**: 2026-02-10  
**Branch**: `build/eol-clean-invariant`  
**HEAD**: `37bf665f6a90ffaf774f457d9b9805357dff6c17`  
**Supersedes**: `Review_Packet_EOL_Clean_Invariant_v2.0.md`

## Scope Envelope

### Allowed Paths

- `runtime/tools/coo_land_policy.py` — Config-aware clean gate + receipt emission
- `runtime/tools/coo_acceptance_policy.py` — Acceptance/closure validator (NEW)
- `runtime/tools/coo_worktree.sh` — Gate integration at choke-points
- `runtime/tests/test_coo_land_policy.py` — Tests
- `runtime/tests/test_coo_acceptance_policy.py` — Tests (NEW)
- `.gitattributes` — CRLF safety exceptions for *.bat/*.cmd
- `artifacts/acceptance/SCHEMA__Acceptance_Closure_v1.0.md` — Schema (NEW)
- `artifacts/evidence/` — Curated receipts (RECEIPT__*.md) and gate receipts
- `artifacts/notes/REPORT__Doc_Stewardship_Status__v1.0.md` — Report (NEW)
- `docs/02_protocols/EOL_Policy_v1.0.md` — Canonical EOL policy doc (NEW)
- `docs/11_admin/LIFEOS_STATE.md`, `docs/11_admin/BACKLOG.md`, `docs/INDEX.md` — Stewardship

### Evidence Storage Contract

- **Curated Evidence**: `artifacts/evidence/RECEIPT__*.md` files are part of the repository to provide a permanent audit record of design decisions and verification proofs. They are forced-staged with `git add -f`.
- **Gate Receipts**: JSON receipts generated by `clean-check --receipt` (e.g., `FINAL_CLEAN_CHECK_RECEIPT.json`) are tracked to provide machine-verifiable proof of state.
- **Untracked Ephemeral Evidence**: Subdirectories such as `artifacts/evidence/openclaw/jobs/` contain high-churn execution logs and are gitignored to avoid repository bloat.

## Summary

Eliminated persistent CRLF/EOL "dirty repo" condition caused by system-level `core.autocrlf=true` (Windows Git default) conflicting with repository `.gitattributes eol=lf`.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier receipts (e.g., `RECEIPT__Renormalization_Mechanical_EOL__2026-02-10.md`) were captured at their respective commit times (e.g., `b4d8713`) to preserve atomic provenance. They remain valid because the files they describe have not changed substantively; only documentation and metadata have been added downstream. Final verification proofs at HEAD `e02d9b9` are captured in `RECEIPT__EOL_Final_Closure_Proof__2026-02-10.md`.
