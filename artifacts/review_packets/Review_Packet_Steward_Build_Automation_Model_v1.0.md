# Review Packet - Steward Build Automation Model Doc

## Summary
The `ARCH — Future Build Automation Operating Model v0.1 (Draft).md` document was stewarded into the canonical documentation structure. It was moved to `docs/00_foundations/`, renamed to strictly use underscores, and indexed. The Universal Corpus was regenerated.

## Issue Catalogue
| ID | Issue | Resolution |
|----|-------|------------|
| 1 | Document in `docs/` root (violation of clean root) | Moved to `docs/00_foundations/` |
| 2 | Filename contained spaces and em dash | Renamed to `ARCH_Future_Build_Automation_Operating_Model_v0.1_Draft.md` |
| 3 | Document not indexed | Added to `docs/INDEX.md` |
| 4 | Corpus outdated | Regenerated `LifeOS_Universal_Corpus.md` |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] File does not exist at `docs/` root.
- [x] File exists at `docs/00_foundations/ARCH_Future_Build_Automation_Operating_Model_v0.1_Draft.md`.
- [x] `docs/INDEX.md` contains a link to the new file.
- [x] `docs/LifeOS_Universal_Corpus.md` contains the content of the file.

## Non-Goals
- Editing the content of the document itself.
