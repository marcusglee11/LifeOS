# Review Packet: LifeOS Overview Document

**Mode**: Lightweight Stewardship
**Date**: 2026-01-11
**Files Changed**: 3

## Summary

Created a high-level "brochure" style overview document (`docs/LifeOS_Overview.md`) to provide a non-technical entry point to LifeOS, covering Purpose, Overview, Solution (Architecture), Progress, and Target State.

Execution included mandatory Document Stewardship:

- Updated `docs/INDEX.md` timestamp.
- Regenerated `docs/LifeOS_Strategic_Corpus.md`.

## Changes

# LifeOS Overview

> A personal operating system that makes you the CEO of your life.

**LifeOS** extends your operational reach into the world. It converts intent into action, thought into artifact, and direction into execution. Its primary purpose is to **augment and amplify human agency and judgment**, not to originate intent.

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

### The Philosophy: CEO Supremacy
In LifeOS, **You are the CEO**. The system is your **COO** and workforce.
- **CEO (You)**: The sole source of strategic intent. You define identity, values, priorities, and direction.
- **The System**: Exists solely to execute your intent. It does not "think" for you on strategic matters; it ensures your decisions are carried out.

### Core Principles
- **Audit Completeness**: Everything is logged. If it happened, it is recorded.
- **Reversibility**: The system is versioned. You can undo actions.
- **Transparency**: No black boxes. Reasoning is visible and auditable.

---

## 2. The Solution: How It Works

LifeOS operates on a strictly tiered architecture to separate **Intent** from **Execution**.

### High-Level Model
| Layer | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **1. CEO** | **Intent** | Defines *what* needs to be done and *why*. |
| **2. COO** | **Operations** | Converts intent into structured **Missions**. Manages the workforce. |
| **3. Workers** | **Execution** | Deterministic agents that perform bounded tasks (Build, Verify, Research). |

### The Autonomy Ladder (System Capability)
The system evolves through "Tiers" of capability, earning more autonomy as it proves safety:
- **Tier 1 (Kernel)**: Deterministic, manual execution. (Foundation)
- **Tier 2 (Orchestration)**: System manages the workflow, human triggers tasks.
- **Tier 3 (Construction)**: specialized agents (Builders) perform work. **<-- Current Status**
- **Tier 4 (Agency)**: System plans and prioritized work over time.
- **Tier 5 (Self-Improvement)**: The system improves its own code to better serve the CEO.

---

## 3. Progress: Current Status

**Current Status**: **Tier-2.5 / Tier-3 Active**
- The system can currently **build, test, and verify** its own code under strict supervision.
- **Active Agents**: 'Antigravity' (General Purpose), 'OpenCode' (Stewardship).
- **Recent Wins**:
    - **Mission Types**: Structured workflows for standardized work.
    - **Stewardship**: Automated documentation and governance checks.

---

## 4. Target State: The North Star

**Goal**: A fully "Self-Improving Organisation Engine".
The target state is a system where the CEO (User) interacts only at the **Intent Layer**, and the system handles the entire chain of **Plan → Build → Verify → Integrate**.

### The Builder North Star
- **Single Interface**: The CEO interacts with one control plane (the COO), not dozens of tools.
- **Packets, Not Chat**: Agents communicate via structured, auditable data packets, not loose conversation.
- **Governance as Code**: Protocol rules (The "Constitution") are enforced by the runtime code.
- **Evidence-Based**: Nothing is "Done" until cryptographic evidence (logs, test results) proves it.

LifeOS is not just productivity software; it is a **Cybernetic extension of human will**, built to rigorous engineering standards.
