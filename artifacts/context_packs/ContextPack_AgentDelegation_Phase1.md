## 1. DOC_STEWARD_REQUEST / DOC_STEWARD_RESULT Definition

**Source**: `docs/00_foundations/ARCH_Builder_North-Star_Operating_Model_v0.5.md`
**Lines**: 164-165, 200

```markdown
8) **Stewardship**
- `DOC_STEWARD_REQUEST` / `DOC_STEWARD_RESULT`
```

```markdown
   → DL_DOC: DOC_STEWARD_REQUEST → DOC_STEWARD_RESULT
```

**Status**: Referenced in Operating Model but NOT defined in `lifeos_packet_schemas_v1.yaml`

---

## 2. DL_DOC Ledger Topology

**Source**: `docs/00_foundations/ARCH_Builder_North-Star_Operating_Model_v0.5.md`
**Lines**: 106-109

```markdown
**Domain ledgers** — detailed operational truth per domain
- **DL_BUILD:** build/verify/integration execution packets + evidence refs
- **DL_GOV:** council cycles, rulings, dispositions + evidence refs
- **DL_DOC:** doc stewardship requests/results + reports
```

**Status**: Defined conceptually. No `artifacts/ledger/dl_doc/` directory exists yet.

## 3. Governance Follows Capability Rule

**Source**: `docs/00_foundations/ARCH_LifeOS_Operating_Model_v0.3.md`
**Lines**: 41-44

```markdown
### 2.4. Governance Follows Capability

The existing governance framework is ahead of execution capability. New governance 
documentation is blocked until execution catches up. Govern what exists, not what might exist.
```

---

## 4. Tool Choice Is Implementation Detail

**Source**: `docs/00_foundations/ARCH_Builder_North-Star_Operating_Model_v0.5.md`
**Line**: 40

```markdown
9) **Tool choice is an implementation detail:** Roles must not be named after tools 
   (e.g., "OpenCode" is an endpoint implementation, not a role).
```

## 5. Schema Gap Analysis

| Element | Expected Location | Status |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `DOC_STEWARD_REQUEST` schema | `lifeos_packet_schemas_v1.yaml` | **MISSING** |
| `DOC_STEWARD_RESULT` schema | `lifeos_packet_schemas_v1.yaml` | **MISSING** |
| `DL_DOC` ledger directory | `artifacts/ledger/dl_doc/` | **MISSING** |

**Impact on Phase 1**: Non-blocking. We can define minimal schemas inline for shadow mode, then formalize to YAML at Gate G3.
