# Review Packet: Tool Invoke Hardening Phase 2

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Date** | 2026-01-10 |
| **Author** | Antigravity |
| **Status** | COMPLETE |
| **Verdict** | PASS |

---

## Summary

Implemented Phase 2 hardening for the `tool_invoke` execution substrate:

- CI enforcement of symlink test execution on non-Windows (Verified: [Run #20879253047](https://github.com/marcusglee11/LifeOS/actions/runs/20879253047))
- Verified error.type semantics are properly locked
- Declared decision_reason as non-contract-stable
- **Verified Linux execution** (via GHA): 57 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
- **Portability Fixes**:
  - Updated `pytest_runner.py` to use `sys.executable` (Fixed Linux PermissionError)
  - Fixed Unicode emoji encoding in `verify_tool_invoke_coverage.py` (Fixed Windows CI console error)

## Issue Catalogue

| # | Issue | Resolution |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | Symlink tests skip on Windows | Allowed; enforced on Linux CI |
| 2 | decision_reason stability | Declared non-stable; tests check presence only |
| 3 | Portability failure on Linux | Fixed: Replaced hardcoded "python" with `sys.executable` |
| 4 | Unicode error on Windows CI | Fixed: Replaced emojis with ASCII markers in verifier |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|-----------|
| Plan updated with P0 clarifications | ✅ PASS |
| CI includes Linux job for symlink enforcement | ✅ PASS |
| Windows job permits symlink skips | ✅ PASS |
| error.type assertions locked | ✅ PASS |
| Evidence report produced | ✅ PASS (CI Substantiated) |

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

- No new tool capabilities
- No git mutation verbs
- No schema changes

---

## Files Changed (Sorted)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/tool_invoke_hardening.yml` | NEW |
| `runtime/tools/pytest_runner.py` | MODIFIED (Portability Fix) |
| `scripts/verify_tool_invoke_coverage.py` | NEW (Emoji Fix Applied) |
| `artifacts/TEST_REPORT_TOOL_INVOKE_HARDENING_PHASE2.md` | NEW |
