# Closure & Acceptance — S1 Phase 1 (Deferred Evidence: F3/F4/F7) — Phase 3 Condition C2

**Decision**: ACCEPT (doc-only evidence closure)
**Date**: 2026-01-27 (Australia/Sydney)

## Scope

Accept F3/F4/F7 as *documentation deliverables* satisfying Phase 3 Closure Condition C2 (deferred evidence). This acceptance does **not** claim runtime enforcement, validators, or end-to-end autonomous loop success.

## Accepted artefacts (canonical paths)

- F3 Review Packet: `artifacts/review_packets/Review_Packet_F3_Tier2.5_Activation_v1.0.md`
- F4 Review Packet: `artifacts/review_packets/Review_Packet_F4_Tier2.5_Deactivation_v1.0.md`
- F7 Review Packet: `artifacts/review_packets/Review_Packet_F7_Runtime_Antigrav_Protocol_v1.0.md`
- Micro-fix Review Packet: `artifacts/review_packets/Review_Packet_MicroFix_Close_F3_F4_F7_v1.0.md`
- Micro-fix Implementation Report: `artifacts/Implementation_Report__MicroFix_Close_F3_F4_F7_v1.0.md`

## Key clarification (micro-fix)

Each of F3/F4/F7 packets is explicitly marked:
“Verified via structural checklist/manual inspection only (no automated validator run recorded).”

## Provenance anchors (as recorded in packets)

- Implementation commit: `54bc29a`
- Doc relocation commit: `23ddb8e`

## Bookkeeping

- BACKLOG marks F3/F4/F7 deferred evidence complete.
- LIFEOS_STATE marks Phase 3 Condition C2 as RESOLVED and references the three packet paths above.

## Next work (out of scope for this note)

Proceed to Sprint S1 Phase B (B1–B3) and Sprint S1 consolidated implementation report.
