# Doc Steward Request: Integrate CLAUDE.md

## Background

A new file `CLAUDE.md` has been created at the repository root by Claude Code. This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) instances when working in this repository.

## File Details

- **Path**: `CLAUDE.md` (repository root)
- **Purpose**: Claude Code agent guidance
- **Companion to**: `AGENTS.md` (OpenCode), `GEMINI.md` (Gemini)
- **Status**: Created and staged for commit

## Content Summary

CLAUDE.md contains:

1. **Essential Development Commands**: pytest commands, doc steward CLI operations, pre-commit checklist, OpenCode CI validation
2. **High-Level Architecture**: Authority chain (Constitution → Governance Protocol → Operating Contracts), core components (runtime, project_builder, recursive_kernel, doc_steward), tier progression model
3. **Governance & Protocol System**: Constitution v2.0 invariants, protected paths, Council Protocol v1.2, Document Steward Protocol v1.1, DAP v2.0, Anti-Failure requirements
4. **Critical Navigation Points**: docs/INDEX.md, LIFEOS_STATE.md, Strategic Corpus
5. **Developer Constraints**: Test coverage (100% core, 80%+ support), determinism requirements, evidence/audit requirements

## Required Actions

### 1. Update README.md

Add CLAUDE.md to the repository structure list. Current structure:

```markdown
## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: Authoritative governance and specifications.
- `runtime/`: The LifeOS COO Runtime implementation (Python).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for maintenance, stewardship, and usage.
- `artifacts/`: Agent-generated artifacts (plans, packets, evidence).
- `tests/`: Project-level tests.
```

**Add this line**:
```markdown
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code agent guidance file.
```

### 2. Update docs/INDEX.md

Add entry for CLAUDE.md. Create a new "Agent Guidance (Root Level)" section near the Strategic Context section:

```markdown
## Agent Guidance (Root Level)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) | Claude Code (claude.ai/code) agent guidance |
| [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) | OpenCode agent instructions (Doc Steward subset) |
| [GEMINI.md](../GEMINI.md) | Gemini agent constitution |
```

### 3. Update Timestamp

Update the `docs/INDEX.md` header timestamp to `2026-01-08T<current_time>+11:00`.

## Verification Checklist

After changes:
- [ ] README.md references CLAUDE.md in repository structure
- [ ] docs/INDEX.md contains link to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] docs/INDEX.md timestamp is updated
- [ ] No broken links introduced
- [ ] Corpus regeneration completed (if required)

## Notes

- CLAUDE.md is at root level, outside `docs/` directory
- Doc steward should only update references/indexes to acknowledge its existence
- No governance paths affected (CLAUDE.md is not in protected paths)
- This is an INDEX_UPDATE mission - no structural changes to docs/
