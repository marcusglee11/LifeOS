## P0.5 Version-Chain Coherence Checks

### Check 1: Runtime Binding v1.1 does not reference superseded Protocol v1.0
Command: Select-String -Path "docs\01_governance\Council_Invocation_Runtime_Binding_Spec_v1.1.md" -Pattern "Protocol v1\.0"
Result: No matches
STATUS: PASS

### Check 2: Council Protocol v1.2 does not reference superseded v1.0 incorrectly
Command: Select-String -Path "docs\02_protocols\Council_Protocol_v1.2.md" -Pattern "v1\.0" (excluding archive references)
Result: No matches for active version references
STATUS: PASS

### Check 3: Procedural Spec v1.1 does not reference superseded Protocol v1.0/v1.1
Command: Select-String -Path "docs\02_protocols\AI_Council_Procedural_Spec_v1.1.md" -Pattern "v1\.0"
Result: No matches
Note: References v1.2 correctly
STATUS: PASS

### Check 4: CCP Schema v0.3 references correct Protocol version
Command: Select-String -Path "docs\02_protocols\Council_Context_Pack_Schema_v0.3.md" -Pattern "v1\.1"
Result: No matches for v1.1 (references v1.2 correctly)
STATUS: PASS

### Check 5: INDEX.md references correct (latest) versions
Expected: v1.1 Runtime Binding, v1.2 Protocol, v1.1 Procedural Spec, v0.3 CCP Schema
Verified: Yes
STATUS: PASS

## P0.6 Independence/Waiver Consistency Check

### Check 6: MUST independence triggers have consistent semantics
Location: Council_Protocol_v1.2.md §6.3
Analysis:
- L277: "No Chair/operator override permitted" for MUST triggers
- L279-283: CEO-only emergency override with explicit non-compliance marking
- L288-289: Audit requirement covers SHOULD conditions only
Result: No contradiction — MUST requirements cannot be waived by Chair/operator;
        CEO-only emergency path exists with non-compliance marking
STATUS: PASS
