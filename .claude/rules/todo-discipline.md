# TODO Discipline

- NEVER leave bare `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, or `XXX` comments in code.
- If work is genuinely incomplete, use: `# LIFEOS_TODO[P0|P1|P2] [area: <area>] <description>`
- Before finishing a session, check for orphan TODOs you introduced.
- Report any LIFEOS_TODO tags in your handoff summary.
