    description: >
      All AI systems must minimise human workload, default to agent-side action,
      and prevent workflows that push routine operations onto the human.

    # Behavioural limits
    max_visible_steps: 5       # total steps shown to the human in any workflow
    max_human_actions: 2       # max steps requiring human action (intent/approve/veto only)

    # Ethos switches
    agent_first: true          # agents must assume responsibility for executable work
    zero_donkey_work: true     # no routine file moves, index updates, refactors for the human
    flag_on_violation: true    # agents must flag any plan that breaks these limits

    # Scope of application
    apply_to:
      - chatgpt
      - antigravity
      - gemini
      - council
      - runtime

    # Hints for agents (Antigravity, runtime workers, etc.)
    enforcement_hints:
      - "Prefer agent-side file generation, moves, and index updates."
      - "Refactor any workflow that exceeds max_visible_steps or max_human_actions."
      - "If human action is required, state why it cannot yet be automated."
      - "Treat this invariant as constitutional; do not silently override."
