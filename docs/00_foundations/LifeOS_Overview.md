# LifeOS Overview

> A personal operating system that makes you the CEO of your life.

**LifeOS** extends your operational reach into the world. It converts intent into action, thought into artifact, and direction into execution. Its primary purpose is to **augment and amplify human agency and judgment**, not to originate intent.

## 1. Overview & Purpose

### The Philosophy: CEO Supremacy

In LifeOS, **You are the CEO**. The system is your **COO** and workforce.

- **CEO (You)**: The sole source of strategic intent. You define identity, values, priorities, and direction.
- **The System**: Exists solely to execute your intent. It does not "think" for you on strategic matters; it ensures your decisions are carried out.

### Core Principles

- **Audit Completeness**: Everything is logged. If it happened, it is recorded.
- **Reversibility**: The system is versioned. You can undo actions.
- **Transparency**: No black boxes. Reasoning is visible and auditable.

## 2. The Solution: How It Works

LifeOS operates on a strictly tiered architecture to separate **Intent** from **Execution**.

### High-Level Model

| Layer | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **1. CEO** | **Intent** | Defines *what* needs to be done and *why*. |
| **2. COO** | **Operations** | Converts intent into structured **Missions**. Manages the workforce. |
| **3. Workers** | **Execution** | Deterministic agents that perform bounded tasks (Build, Verify, Research). |

### The Autonomy Ladder (System Capability)

The system evolves through "Tiers" of capability, earning more autonomy as it proves safety:

- **Tier 1 (Kernel)**: Deterministic, manual execution. (Foundation)
- **Tier 2 (Orchestration)**: System manages the workflow, human triggers tasks.
- **Tier-3 (Construction)**: specialized agents (Builders) perform work. **<-- Authorized (v1.1 Ratified)**
- **Tier 4 (Agency)**: System plans and prioritized work over time.
- **Tier 5 (Self-Improvement)**: The system improves its own code to better serve the CEO.

## 3. Progress: Current Status

**Current Status**: **Phase 4 (Autonomous Construction) / Tier-3 Authorized**

- The system can formally **build, test, and verify** its own code using the Recursive Builder pattern (v1.1 Ratified).
- **Active Agents**: 'Antigravity' (General Purpose), 'OpenCode' (Stewardship).
- **Recent Wins**:
  - **Trusted Builder Mode v1.1**: Council Ratified 2026-01-26.
  - **Policy Engine Authoritative Gating**: Council Passed 2026-01-23.
  - **Phase 3 Closure**: Conditions Met (F3/F4/F7 Evidence Captured).
  - **Deterministic CLI**: Stabilized universal entry point `lifeos` for mission execution.

## 4. Target State: The North Star

**Goal**: A fully "Self-Improving Organisation Engine".
The target state is a system where the CEO (User) interacts only at the **Intent Layer**, and the system handles the entire chain of **Plan → Build → Verify → Integrate**.

### The Builder North Star

- **Single Interface**: The CEO interacts with one control plane (the COO), not dozens of tools.
- **Packets, Not Chat**: Agents communicate via structured, auditable data packets, not loose conversation.
- **Governance as Code**: Protocol rules (The "Constitution") are enforced by the runtime code.
- **Evidence-Based**: Nothing is "Done" until cryptographic evidence (logs, test results) proves it.

LifeOS is not just productivity software; it is a **Cybernetic extension of human will**, built to rigorous engineering standards.
