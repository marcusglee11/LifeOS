# LifeOS Architecture Skeleton (High-Level Model)

High-level conceptual architecture for the LifeOS system.  
Governance lives in the COO Operating Contract.  
Technical implementation lives in COOSpecv1.0Final.md.

## 1. Purpose
Provide a unified mental model for:
- How intent → missions → execution flow.
- How CEO, COO, and Worker Agents interact.
- How the LifeOS layers produce stable momentum.

## 2. LifeOS Layers

### 2.1 CEO (Intent Layer)
- Defines identity, values, priorities, direction.

### 2.2 COO (Operational Layer)
- Converts intent into structured missions.
- Manages execution, quality, agents, and schedules.
- Maintains operational momentum.

### 2.3 Worker Agents (Execution Layer)
- Perform bounded tasks.
- Output deterministic results.
- No strategic autonomy.

## 3. Mission Flow

1. Intent → mission proposal.
2. Mission approval when required.
3. Execution planning.
4. Worker agent execution.
5. Review & integration.
6. Mission closeout.

## 4. Architecture Principles
- Strict separation of intent and execution.
- Deterministic processes.
- Continuous improvement.
- Minimal friction.
- Coherence across workstreams.

## 5. Relationship to Implementation
This describes the *conceptual model*.  
The COOSpec defines the actual runtime mechanics: SQLite message bus, deterministic lifecycle, Docker sandbox, and agent orchestration.
