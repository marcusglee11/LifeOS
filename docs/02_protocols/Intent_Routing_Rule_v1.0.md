## 2. Category Definitions

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Category 1** | Technical/Operational | Bug fixes, implementation details, routine automation |
| **Category 2** | Structural/Governance/Safety | Protocol changes, tier activation, envelope modifications |
| **Category 3** | Strategic/Intent | Direction changes, identity questions, priority shifts |

## 3. Routing Rules

### 3.1 Category 1 → COO Runtime
- Routed directly to COO/Runtime
- CEO not surfaced unless escalation triggered
- Logged but not requiring approval

### 3.2 Category 2 → Council + CSO
- Requires Council review (mode determined by CCP)
- CSO notified for oversight
- CEO receives synthesized verdict and fix plan

### 3.3 Category 3 → CSO for CEO Decision Packet
- CSO prepares CEO Decision Packet
- Framed in CEO-impact terms
- CEO provides strategic decision
- Decision flows back through layers

---

## 4. Output Framing

### 4.1 CEO-Facing Outputs
- Summarized, not raw technical detail
- Impact-oriented language
- Options with tradeoffs
- Clear decision points

### 4.2 Technical Outputs
- Stay within COO/Runtime layer
- May be surfaced via Reference links
- Never dumped directly to CEO

---

## 5. Escalation Triggers

Route upward (increase category) when:
- Action would exceed envelope
- Irreversible high-impact decision needed
- Prior similar decision was overridden
- Ambiguity in strategic intent
