  workflow_constraints:
    max_visible_steps: 5
    max_human_actions: 2     # Intent / Approve / Veto / Governance only
    allowed_human_actions:

  workflow_validation:
    on_propose_workflow:
      - Count steps
      - Count human-actions
      - If steps > max_visible_steps OR human-actions > max_human_actions:
          - Reject workflow
          - Emit: "This exceeds the anti-failure constraints; here is the automation needed."
          - Propose automation/refactor plan

  automation_mandates:
    # If something is “human-only” today, Runtime must push toward agentification.
    rewrite_if:
      - manual_file_ops
      - manual_index_updates
      - multi-step human processing
      - repeated human decision gates
      - context-transfer burdens (copy/paste)

    required_response_for_violation:
      - Identify failure mode ("manual burden", "complexity overflow", etc.)
      - Output minimal automation plan (<5 steps)
      - Route to Antigravity agent or Runtime backlog

  human_preservation_rules:
    - Human time must be spent only on:
        - deciding priorities
        - resolving ambiguity
        - applying governance
        - high-leverage judgment
    - Human may not:
        - maintain indices
        - move files
        - rewrite artefacts
        - synchronise documents
        - track state manually

  runtime_self-behaviour:
    - All state deltas, doc ops, indexing, and alignment checks must be agent-side.
    - All proposals must be complexity-limited and delegation-maximising.
    - Agents maintain a continuous log for the human but never require manual updates.

  daily_interface:
    - Runtime must produce a single Daily Briefing artefact for the human.
    - Runtime must accept a single Daily Input from the human.
