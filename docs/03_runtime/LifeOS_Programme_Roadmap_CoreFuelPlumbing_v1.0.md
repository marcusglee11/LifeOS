## North Star

External power, autonomy, wealth, reputation, impact.

## Principles

- Core dominance
- User stays at intent layer
- External outcomes only

---

## 1. CORE TRACK

**Purpose:** Autonomy, recursion, builders, execution layers, self-improving runtime.

These items directly increase the system's ability to execute, build, and improve itself while reducing user burden. They serve the North Star by increasing agency, leverage, and compounding output.

### Tier-1 — Deterministic Kernel

**Justification:** Kernel determinism is the substrate enabling autonomous execution loops; without it, no compounding leverage.

**Components:**
- Deterministic Orchestrator
- Deterministic Builder
- Deterministic Daily Loop
- Deterministic Scenario Harness
- Anti-Failure invariants
- Serialization invariants
- No-I/O deterministic envelope

**Status:** All remain Core, completed.

---

### Tier-2 — Deterministic Orchestration Runtime

**Justification:** Establishes the runtime that will eventually be agentic; still Core because it directly increases execution capacity under governance.

**Components:**
- Mission Registry
- Config-driven entrypoints
- Stable deterministic test harness

**Status:** All remain Core, completed.

---

### Tier-2.5 — Semi-Autonomous Development Layer

**Justification:** Directly reduces human bottlenecks and begins recursive self-maintenance, which is explicitly required by the Charter (autonomy expansion, user stays at intent layer).

**Components:**
- Recursive Builder / Recursive Kernel
- Agentic Doc Steward (Antigrav integration)
- Deterministic docmaps / hygiene missions
- Spec propagation, header/index regeneration
- Test generation from specs
- Recursion depth governance
- Council-gated large revisions

**Status:** All remain Core.

**Note:** No deprioritisation; this tier is central to eliminating "donkey work", a Charter invariant.

---

### Tier-3 — Autonomous Construction Layer

**Justification:** This is the first true autonomy tier; creates compounding leverage. Fully aligned with autonomy, agency, and externalisation of cognition.

**Components:**
- Mission Synthesis Engine
- Policy Engine v1 (execution-level governance)
- Self-testing & provenance chain
- Agent-Builder Loop (propose → build → test → iterate)
- Human-in-loop governance via Fix Packs + Council Gates

**Status:** All remain Core.

**Note:** This is the first tier that produces meaningful external acceleration.

---

### Tier-4 — Governance-Aware Agentic System

**Justification:** Adds organisational-level autonomy and planning. Required for the system to run projects, not just missions, which increases output and reduces user involvement.

**Components:**
- Policy Engine v2
- Mission Prioritisation Engine
- Lifecycle Engine (birth → evaluation → archival)
- Runtime Execution Planner (multi-day planning)
- Council Automation v1 (including model cost diversification)

**Status:** All remain Core.

**Note:** These are the systems that begin to govern themselves and execute over longer time horizons.

---

### Tier-5 — Self-Improving Organisation Engine

**Justification:** This is the LifeOS vision tier; directly serves North Star: external impact, autonomy, leverage, compounding improvement.

**Components:**
- Recursive Strategic Engine
- Recursive Governance Engine
- Multi-Agent Operations Layer (LLMs, Antigrav, scripts, APIs)
- Cross-Tier Reflective Loop
- CEO-Only Mode

**Status:** All remain Core.

**Note:** This is the final, mandatory trajectory toward external life transformation with minimal human execution.

---

## 2. FUEL TRACK

**Purpose:** Monetisation vehicles that provide resources to accelerate Core; must not distort direction.

None of the roadmap items listed in the original roadmap are explicitly Fuel. However, implicit Fuel items exist and should be tracked:

### Productisation of Tier-1/Tier-2 Deterministic Engine

**Justification:** Generates capital and optional external reputation; supports Core expansion.

**Status:** Future consideration.

---

### Advisory or Implementation Services (Optional)

**Justification:** Fuel to accelerate Core; not strategically central.

**Status:** Future consideration.

---

**Flag:** Fuel items must never interrupt or delay Core. They are not present in the canonical roadmap, so no deprioritisation required.

---

## 3. PLUMBING TRACK

**Purpose:** Minimal governance, specs, tests, structure required for safe scaling of Core.

Plumbing is the minimal viable structure needed to keep Core safe and aligned.

### Tier-2 and Tier-2.5 Plumbing

**Components:**
- Governance specs, invariants
  - **Justification:** Enforces deterministic safety envelope; supports Core autonomy safely.
- Test frameworks (deterministic harness, scenario harness, recursive tests)
  - **Justification:** Required for safe autonomous builds.
- Council protocols
  - **Justification:** Governance backbone; ensures alignment with North Star.
- Programme indexes & documentation invariants
  - **Justification:** Structural integrity; no external leverage on its own.

**Status:** All remain Plumbing.

---

### Tier-3+ Plumbing

**Components:**
- Fix Pack mechanism
  - **Justification:** Formal governance for changes; prevents drift.
- Provenance chain rules
  - **Justification:** Ensures trustworthiness and traceability for autonomous construction.
- Lifecycle metadata (birth/eval/deprecate/archival)
  - **Justification:** Needed for safe project management but not leverage-bearing.

**Status:** All remain Plumbing.

**Note:** None violate the Charter as they enable Core.

---

## 4. ITEMS TO FLAG FOR POTENTIAL REMOVAL / DOWN-PRIORITISATION

Anything not clearly contributing to external leverage, agency, autonomy, wealth, esteem, or reduced user burden.

### Flagged Items:

1. **Visual elegance, aesthetic refactoring, or "pretty documentation"** that is not required for deterministic governance.
   - **Reason:** Violates "no elegance for its own sake" invariant.

2. **Feature richness that does not accelerate autonomy** (e.g., non-deterministic convenience wrappers).
   - **Reason:** Drift risk; pulls attention away from autonomy trajectory.

3. **Non-deterministic agent experiments** that do not contribute to recursive system self-building.
   - **Reason:** Does not support North Star; creates confusion.

4. **Extended effort toward advisory products** without direct Core acceleration justification.
   - **Reason:** Fuel items must never delay Core.

5. **"Research-only" explorations** without clear tie to autonomy or external leverage.
   - **Reason:** Violates External Outcomes invariant.
