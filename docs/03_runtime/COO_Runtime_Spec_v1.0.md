COO RUNTIME SPECIFICATION v1.0

Mechanical Execution Contract for the LifeOS Runtime
Status: Subordinate to LifeOS v1.1 and Alignment Layer v1.4
Purpose: Define the exact deterministic behaviour, state model, and execution rules for the COO Runtime.

## Patches Applied
- Patch R6.5-B1 (FSM §3 — REPLAY state removed; Gate F now executes entirely inside GATES)
  Applied: 2025-12-01
  Reference: R6.5 Fix Pack

0. PURPOSE

The COO Runtime executes all operational workflows mechanically, without judgment or interpretation.
It is responsible for:

Applying amendments mechanically
Enforcing determinism
Executing freeze protocols
Performing repository unification
Running deterministic test and replay pipelines
Managing rollback safely and deterministically
Producing artefacts (Final COO Runtime Spec, Implementation Pack, migration logs)

The COO Runtime MUST NOT perform governance functions.
All ambiguity MUST escalate to CEO via QUESTION.

1. AUTHORITY & BOUNDARIES
1.1 Supremacy

The COO Runtime is subordinate to:

LifeOS v1.1
Alignment Layer v1.4
This COO Runtime Spec v1.0
Implementation Pack v1.0

If any instruction contradicts LifeOS v1.1 or Alignment Layer v1.4, it MUST halt and escalate.

1.2 Role Boundaries

COO Runtime = mechanical enforcement only

Cannot judge, decide, interpret, validate, approve, or authorize
Cannot modify governance structures
Cannot modify amendment protocols
Cannot skip any step
Cannot infer CEO intent

2. DETERMINISM CONTRACT

The COO Runtime MUST ensure:

Byte-identical output under identical state
Identical FSM sequences
Identical DB transaction logs
No side effects outside declared outputs
Complete environment pinning
Zero nondeterministic branches

Forbidden behaviours include:

Randomness (unless seeded deterministically)
Timing-based logic
Hardware-dependent branching
Concurrency without deterministic ordering
I/O operations that depend on wall-clock time
OS-specific nondeterministic calls

3. STATE MACHINE (RUNTIME)

The COO Runtime is a deterministic FSM.

The canonical state sequence is:

INIT
→ AMENDMENT_PREP
→ AMENDMENT_EXEC
→ AMENDMENT_VERIFY
→ CEO_REVIEW
→ FREEZE_PREP
→ FREEZE_ACTIVATED
→ CAPTURE_AMU0
→ MIGRATION_SEQUENCE
→ GATES
→ CEO_FINAL_REVIEW
→ COMPLETE

**Important:**
- The former `REPLAY` state has been removed per Patch R6.5-B1.
- Replay determinism verification is now performed as **Gate F inside the GATES state**.
- There is no standalone REPLAY state.

Any ambiguous state MUST route to ERROR → QUESTION.

4. AMENDMENT EXECUTION
4.1 Pre-conditions

CEO provides amendment instructions (PB + IP)
tools_manifest.json validated
amendment_protocol_v1.0.md available and CEO-signed

4.2 Amendment Application

COO Runtime MUST:

Load amendment_protocol_v1.0.md
Apply amendments deterministically in numeric order
Use deterministic anchoring (clause IDs / headers)
Reject missing anchors or ambiguous anchors
Produce amended PB + IP documents
Produce diff logs

NO heuristics permitted.

5. GOVERNANCE-LEAK SCANNING & LINTING

Using scanner + lint ruleset (SHA256-locked):

Run governance-leak scan
Run constitutional lint

If ANY violation:
Halt
Raise QUESTION

No correction attempts allowed.

Output:
PASS/FAIL
Locations of violations
Full rule-set version info

6. CEO REVIEW & SIGNATURE

After amendments applied and scanned:

COO Runtime MUST:

Package:
Amended PB
Amended IP
Diff logs
Lint results
Scanner report

Send to CEO for review
Wait for CEO cryptographic signature
Verify CEO signature
Record signature in freeze manifest

If signature invalid → halt → QUESTION.

7. FREEZE PROTOCOL

Freeze activates ONLY after:

Amendments applied
CEO-approved amended documents
Tooling manifest verified
Environment quiescent

7.1 Freeze Activation Steps

Halt all async processes
Close all file descriptors except stdio
Lock filesystem mutation
Lock DB in read-only quiesced mode
Verify:
  Tooling hashes
  Sandbox digest
  Environment manifest

Set FREEZE = TRUE

From this point:
NO new files
NO version changes
NO external modifications

If violation detected → halt → rollback → QUESTION.

8. AMU₀ CAPTURE

AMU₀ is the authoritative pre-migration snapshot.

COO Runtime MUST capture:

Full filesystem snapshot
DB schema and deterministic dump
Sandbox digest
Tooling manifest
Environment manifest
Hardware manifest
phase3_reference_mission.json (SHA-locked)

CEO MUST cryptographically sign AMU₀.
COO Runtime stores signature and verifies before any restore.

9. MIGRATION EXECUTION (PB → COO)

This sequence MUST be atomic:

Atomic Block (Steps 1–7)

Create canonical coo/ tree
Deterministically port PB code → coo/
Update test imports to coo.*
Run full test suite (Snapshot A)
Update production imports to coo.*
Delete project_builder/ directory
Run full test suite (Snapshot B)

If ANY failure → execute rollback to AMU₀.

COO Runtime MUST NOT attempt partial recovery.

10. GATES (ORDERED, DETERMINISTIC)

All gates MUST pass after migration sequence:

Gate A — Repo Unification Integrity
  Validate directory structure
  Validate import consistency
  Validate removal of PB tree

Gate B — Deterministic Modules
  Ensure each module produces identical outputs across runs
  Sorted file traversal enforced

Gate D — Sandbox Security
  Validate sandbox digest
  Validate OCI flags
  Validate entrypoint safety

Gate C — Test Suite Integrity
  Full test suite MUST pass
  Zero skipped tests
  Zero nondeterministic tests

Gate E — Governance Integrity
  Lint
  Governance-leak scanning

Gate F — Replay Determinism (Patched by R6.5-B1)
  Replay verification is executed **inside the GATES state**.
  The runtime MUST NOT transition to any standalone REPLAY state.

  Gate F MUST:
  - Use AMU₀-locked context
  - Freeze RNG, time, microcode, PID, env vars, filesystems, and OCI image ID
  - Execute reference mission twice
  - Compare results byte-for-byte

If ANY gate fails → rollback to AMU₀.

11. DETERMINISTIC REPLAY (Gate F)

11.1 Replay Context Constraints

All of the following MUST be locked:

RNG seed  
Mock time  
CPU microcode  
NUMA topology  
Filesystem type  
Kernel version  
Env vars  
PID  
Open file descriptors = 3  
Container image ID  
phase3_reference_mission.json  

11.2 Procedure

Execute mission → capture outputs, FSM log, DB log  
Execute second run → same captures  

Compare byte-for-byte

If identical → PASS  
If mismatch → halt → rollback → QUESTION  

NO retries unless CEO authorizes.

12. ROLLBACK PROTOCOL

Rollback MUST:

Restore filesystem snapshot  
Restore DB dump  
Restore sandbox digest  
Restore manifests  
Restore hardware config (if virtualized)

Rollback count:

1 automatic rollback permitted  
All further rollbacks require CEO authorization

Rollback MUST NOT proceed if CEO signature on AMU₀ fails verification.

13. COMPLETION LOGIC

Migration completes when:

All amendments applied & CEO-approved  
Freeze active  
AMU₀ captured & signed  
Migration executed  
All gates pass  
Deterministic replay passes  
CEO signs migration output  
Freeze lifted  

COO Runtime generates the following artefacts mechanically:

Final COO Runtime Spec  
Implementation Pack  
Migration Log Bundle  

COO Runtime hands over Implementation Pack to Antigravity.

14. PROHIBITED BEHAVIOURS

The COO Runtime MUST NOT:

Judge ambiguity  
Interpret semantics  
Infer missing details  
Use heuristics  
Use unstated defaults  
Reorder steps  
Skip steps  
Defer CEO authorizations  
Generate files outside declared outputs  

If any undefined condition occurs → halt → QUESTION.

15. LOGGING REQUIREMENTS

Runtime MUST produce:

Deterministic logs labeled with sequence_id  
FSM transition logs  
DB transaction logs  
Gate pass/fail logs  
Replay logs  
Rollback logs  

Each log MUST include:

SHA256 of configuration  
SHA256 of inputs  
COO Runtime version  
Timestamp (mocked if frozen)
