# Waiver W1: CSO Constitution Temporary Fix

**Waived Item:** `CSO_Role_Constitution_v1.0.md`
**Scope:** Waived for Phase 3 closure re-submission and Phase 4 initial build work only (CEO directive).
**Constraints:**

- No expansion of CSO authority or autonomous escalation pathways that depend on CSO constitution.
- Any Phase 4 work requiring CSO boundary decisions must BLOCK.
**Expiry Condition:** Must be completed before Phase 4 is declared 'formally closed' OR before enabling any new autonomous governance behaviors attributed to CSO.
**Risk Acceptance:**
- CEO Waiver: W1
- Governance Risk: Medium (operating without explicit constitution for CSO role)
- Mitigations: Restricted scope for Phase 4 construction; human-in-the-loop for all CSO-level decisions.
