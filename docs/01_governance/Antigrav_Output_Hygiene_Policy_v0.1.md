# Antigravity Output Hygiene Policy v0.1
Authority: LifeOS Governance Council
Date: 2025-12-12
Status: ACTIVE

## 1. Zero-Clutter Principle
The **ROOT DIRECTORY** (`c:\Users\cabra\Projects\LifeOS`) is a pristine, canonical namespace. It must **NEVER** contain transient output, logs, or unclassified artifacts.

## 2. Root Protection Rule (Governance Hard Constraint)
Antigravity is **FORBIDDEN** from writing any file to the root directory unless it is a **Mission-Critical System Configuration File** (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`) and explicitly authorized by a specialized Mission Plan.

## 3. Mandatory Output Routing
All generated content must be routed to semantic directories:

| Content Type | Mandatory Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Governance/Docs** | `docs/01_governance/` or `docs/03_runtime/` etc. |
| **Code/Scripts** | `runtime/` or `scripts/` |
| **Logs/Debug** | `logs/` |
| **Artifacts/Packets** | `artifacts/` (or strictly `artifacts/review_packets/`) |
| **Mission State** | `artifacts/missions/` |
| **Misc Data** | `artifacts/misc/` |

## 4. Enforcement
1. **Pre-Computation Check**: Antigravity must check target paths before writing.
2. **Post-Mission Cleanup**: Any file accidentally dropped in root must be moved immediately.

Signed,
LifeOS Governance Council
