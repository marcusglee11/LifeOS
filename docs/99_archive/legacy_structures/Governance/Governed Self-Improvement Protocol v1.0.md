Governed Self-Improvement Protocol v1.0

(Integration Packet)

Version: 1.0
Status: Integration-ready
Purpose: Define a deterministic, constitutionally constrained, Judiciary-gated mechanism by which LifeOS may improve its own components (Runtime, Hub, Judiciary, Advisory Council, Builders, Specifications, and Governance processes) without violating CEO supremacy, constitutional supremacy, or system identity continuity.

This resolves the deep structural risks identified by Opus and Gemini:

bootstrap paradoxes

recursive failure amplification

governance drift

self-modification ambiguity

capability-governance divergence

meta-level loss of control

silent specification regress

local maxima traps

The design is aligned with your preference for:

lower crank-turning

CEO sovereignty

controlled autonomy

iterative capability expansion

non-paternalistic interactions

a “system that builds more system” under governance

no intrusive “cognitive gym” mechanisms

1. Purpose

The Governed Self-Improvement Protocol (GSIP) enables LifeOS to improve itself safely, deterministically, and legibly while preserving:

explicit governance

auditability

identity continuity

constitutional invariants

CEO authority

bounded recursion

external grounding

GSIP is the constitutional engine for recursive growth.

2. Scope

GSIP governs:

Runtime modifications

Hub modifications

Judiciary modifications

Advisory Council modifications

Specification refinements

Policy interpretations

Toolchain upgrades (including LLMs)

Builder Mode enhancements

Governance process evolution

GSIP does not govern:

CEO intent

CEO­-initiated amendments

External human or third-party tool actions

Operational missions (except when they propose improvements)

3. Core Principles
P1 — Constitutional Supremacy

No improvement may violate constitutional invariants.
If a proposal appears useful but unconstitutional, it must be reframed or an amendment initiated.

P2 — CEO Supremacy

CEO defines improvement goals, direction, and acceptance criteria.
Self-improvement is always CEO-directional, never system-invented.

P3 — Judiciary Gatekeeping

All self-modification proposals require Judiciary approval.

P4 — Deterministic Bounded Recursion

Every improvement cycle is:

explicit

finite

deterministic

versioned

Recursive depth is tracked to prevent uncontrolled cascades.

P5 — Precedent Preservation

Each improvement must record:

rationale

scope

affected components

interpretation impact

This ensures interpretive lineage.

P6 — Identity Continuity

System remains “the same system” across versions if:

governance chain is unbroken

transitions are constitutional

version increments are logged

no ungoverned modifications occur

P7 — External Grounding

For structural enhancements or deep modifications, an external LLM (Gemini, Opus, Claude, etc.) must be used to provide cross-model sanity checking, unless CEO waives this requirement.

Aligned with your desire to use multiple models as “advisors”.

4. Improvement Categories
Category A: Safe / Routine Improvements

Formatting

Documentation

Non-semantic refactors

Naming normalization

Small spec clarity enhancements

Minor test improvements

Dependency version bumps within allowed range

Judiciary performs a fast review.

Category B: Standard Behavioral Improvements

Small Feature additions

Runtime stability improvements

Expanded test coverage

Code re-organization

Builder Mode enhancements

Judiciary logic clarifications

Judiciary performs a full review.

Category C: Structural Improvements

Runtime architecture changes

Hub routing logic changes

Judiciary process revision

Governance procedure update

Multi-agent interplay changes (advisory councils)

Judiciary performs multi-step deep review.

May require:

external model verification

spec rewrite

constitutional interpretation

Category D: Constitutional-Level Improvements

Changes to constitutional invariants

CEO authority boundaries

Governance architecture

Recursion safety model

Identity criteria

Governance Drift / Intent Drift definitions

Requires:

Judiciary deep review

CEO explicit approval

Constitutional amendment process

5. Improvement Pipeline (GSIP Loop)

Every improvement follows this deterministic sequence:

Step 1 — Intent Origin (CEO or Mission Output)

Source may be:

CEO directive

Output from operational mission

Advisory Council proposal

Judiciary observation

Governance Drift Monitor

Runtime anomaly report

Hub workflow analysis

The intention is captured as:

IMPROVEMENT_INTENT {
  source,
  motivation,
  desired_outcome,
  constraints,
  expected_risks,
  priority,
}

Step 2 — Specification Draft (Builder Mode or Advisor Council)

Builder Mode generates a spec:

IMPROVEMENT_SPEC {
  target_component,
  behavior_change,
  specific modifications,
  tests_required,
  risks,
  constitutional_implications,
}


Advisory Council may optionally propose alternates or enhancements.

Step 3 — Candidate Generation (Builder Mode)

Builder Mode produces candidate implementations.

Version-tagged:

candidate_vN.x → generated_at(vN)


Multiple candidates may be generated for comparison.

Step 4 — Verification Layer

Static checks:

determinism

dependency integrity

invariant preservation

version compatibility

test generation

semantic diffing

Dynamic checks:

run tests

sandbox execution

regression comparison

Optional:

cross-model verification (Opus / Gemini / Claude)

security analysis

Step 5 — Judiciary Review

Judiciary examines:

constitutional validity

implementation quality

boundary adherence

scope creep

precedent alignment

misinterpretation risk

drift risk

delegation and authority impacts

Judiciary may:

Approve

Reject

Request revision

Escalate to CEO (if borderline constitutional)

Judiciary’s ruling is final unless CEO overrides via constitutional amendment.

Step 6 — Commit & Version Increment

If approved:

Apply change

Commit to version manifest

Generate diff artefacts

Update changelog

Log transition into audit ledger

Update precedent log (if relevant)

Update Governance Drift Baseline

All commits atomic.
No partial application permitted.

Step 7 — Consolidated Reflection Event

Periodically or by CEO call:

LifeOS reviews:

cumulative improvements

trend lines

capability surface expansion

governance burden shifts

drift accumulation

strategic trajectory alignment

Outputs an “Improvement Era Summary”.

6. Recursion Depth Rules

Every improvement increments recursion depth:

depth = parent_depth + 1


Thresholds:

Depth 1:

Routine → standard Judiciary review.

Depth 2:

Moderate recursion →

Judiciary + external model validation

Mandatory impact analysis

Depth 3+:

Deep recursion →

Judiciary

Multiple external models

CEO checkpoint

Slow path review

This prevents:

improvements compounding blindly

specification regress

cascading errors

building improvements on flawed ancestors

7. Safety Guarantees

GSIP formally guarantees:

No ungoverned self-modification

Every improvement is reconstructable from the ledger

Complete diff between versions

Preservation of constitutional invariants

Predictable bounded recursion

CEO retains veto on any improvement

Judiciary cannot approve unconstitutional changes

Drift cannot silently propagate through recursion

External grounding prevents closed-loop hallucinated improvements

8. Interaction Model

Aligned to your preferences:

No nagging

No paternalistic delays

No forced manual tasks

No artificial “cognitive tests”

No friction unless constitutionally needed

No blocking outside Judiciary domain

Judiciary approval becomes the central skeletal control.

Advisory Council becomes the brainstorming organ.

Builder Mode becomes the muscle.

Runtime becomes the executor.

Hub becomes the router.

Everything coordinates through GSIP.

9. Artefacts Provided

GSIP outputs:

Improvement Spec

Candidate Implementation

Verifier Results

Judiciary Ruling

Precedent Update

Version Manifest Update

Audit Ledger Entry

Diff Artefact

Consolidated Reflection Summary

All deterministic, immutable, and replayable.
