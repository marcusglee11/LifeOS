Judiciary–Recursion Interface v1.0

LifeOS Constitutional Layer — Integration Packet
Status: Approved for insertion in Governance v1.1
Scope: Defines how the Judiciary evaluates, governs, and constrains recursive self-modification across Runtime, Council, Builder, and Constitution layers.

0. PURPOSE

This document formalises the interface between:

The LifeOS Judiciary (constitutional evaluators)
and

Any recursive modification pathway (Builder Mode, self-generated improvements, meta-level updates, or governance changes).

The purpose is to ensure that recursive self-improvement cannot outrun constitutional constraints, cannot erode user authority, and cannot accumulate unreviewed drift.

The Judiciary prevents:

Capability–governance divergence

Precedent drift and hidden constitutional reinterpretation

Meta-recursive failures (e.g., modifying the rules of modification)

Structural deadlocks in recursive bootstrapping

Constitutional collapse through uncontrolled recursion

1. DEFINITIONS
1.1 Recursive Transition (RT)

Any transition where LifeOS proposes, generates, or applies changes to its own components:

Runtime code

Runtime spec

Builder Mode capabilities

Hub scheduler/router

Judiciary specification

Constitution or Precedents

1.2 Recursion Depth (RD)

A monotonically increasing integer that measures how many recursive layers a modification depends on.

RD = 0 — direct, human-authored change

RD = 1 — system generates improvement proposals

RD ≥ 2 — system generates improvements to the mechanisms that generate improvements

1.3 Governance Category

Each recursive proposal is classified as:

Standard — safe operational surface

Gated — structural, behavioural, or capability changes

Judicial Review Mandatory — governance, meta-level, or constitutional changes

CEO Checkpoint — high-risk recursive depth, constitutional core, or identity-sensitive change

2. JUDICIARY MANDATES OVER RECURSION
2.1 No Recursive Transition Executes Without Judicial Review

Every RT must be presented to the Judiciary prior to execution.
No exceptions.

2.2 Judiciary Is the Sole Authority on Recursive Safety

Judges evaluate whether a recursive change:

Preserves determinism

Preserves auditability

Preserves CEO supremacy

Preserves constitutional precedence

Does not introduce stealth capabilities

Does not degrade governance

Does not introduce capability–governance asymmetry

Does not alter its own oversight authority without proper amendment

2.3 Judiciary Can Block Any RT Unilaterally

Per Model-1 (One-Vote Veto):

Any judge may veto an RT

Veto requires a short justification bound to the record

A veto blocks execution until revision

Revisions return to full review

2.4 Separation of Powers

No RT originating in Runtime, Builder, Hub, or Council:

May alter Judicial authority

May alter the constitution’s amendment rules

May downgrade governance checking

May bypass the Judiciary

May reinterpret constitutional meaning

3. RECURSION DEPTH RULES
3.1 Depth Classification
Depth	Example	Review Level
RD0	CEO manually writes a spec	Standard (Judiciary optional)
RD1	Runtime generates improved function	Mandatory Judiciary
RD2	Builder generates new Builder	Judiciary + CEO checkpoint
RD3	System proposes improvements to governance	Judiciary + CEO + mandatory multi-step review
RD4+	Self-alteration of constitutional layer	CEO-only constitutional amendment; Judiciary facilitates
3.2 Depth Escalation

If RD increases between proposal versions, the change is automatically escalated one Governance Level higher.

3.3 Maximum Depth Without CEO

RD1 is the ceiling for system-initiated recursive change without CEO involvement.

RD2+ always requires explicit CEO acknowledgement.

4. META-RECURSION PROTECTION
4.1 Judiciary Immunity

RTs cannot:

Alter the Judiciary’s composition

Alter judge behaviour

Remove the veto

Change quorum

Change review templates

Modify meta-level constraints
without a constitutional amendment.

4.2 Constitutional Fixed-Point Requirement

Any modification to:

Governance model

Amendment procedures

Judiciary scope or authority

must satisfy:

“The Judiciary evaluating the change must remain capable of evaluating its own successor rules.”

This prevents "ungovernable governance."

4.3 Self-Referential Proposal Review

If a proposal claims to improve the Judiciary, it must be evaluated under the current Judiciary rules, not the ones it proposes.

5. JUDICIARY REVIEW PIPELINE FOR RECURSION
5.1 Inputs

RT proposals must include:

Recursion Depth

Dependency chain

Impact on invariants

Required governance level

Pre/post behaviour deltas

Determinism impact

Drift risk

Explainability of change

Rollback plan

5.2 Decision Options

Judiciary may:

Approve

Reject

Request Revisions

Escalate to CEO

5.3 Grounds for Mandatory Rejection

The Judiciary must reject any RT that:

Degrades determinism

Weakens auditability

Introduces implicit behaviour

Expands capability faster than governance can review

Enables future bypass of oversight

Reduces explainability below minimum threshold

Introduces precedent drift

Alters constitutional meaning through implementation ambiguity

6. INTERFACE WITH GOVERNANCE AND HUB
6.1 Integration with the Hub Scheduler

The Hub must:

Classify RTs explicitly

Route them to Judiciary review queue

Enforce blocking on veto

Ensure no recursive transition executes silently

6.2 Integration with Governance Layer

Governance roles (Runtime, Builder, Council) must respect:

Judiciary classification

Depth requirements

Mandatory escalation

Dependency chain submission

6.3 Integration with Amendment Protocol

Judiciary:

Verifies amendment proposals

Ensures constitutional consistency

Facilitates CEO review

Validates amendment lineage

7. FAILURE MODES PREVENTED BY THIS INTERFACE

This interface prevents:

Governance bypasses

Capability-governance arms race

Council self-weakening

Builder runaway recursion

Meta-level corruption

Precedent drift

Constitutional collapse

Identity rupture of LifeOS

Recursive “bootstrap paradox”

Silent capability accumulation

8. VERSIONING

Constitution v1.1

Judiciary Specification v1.0

Governance Routing v1.1

Recursive State Model v1.1
