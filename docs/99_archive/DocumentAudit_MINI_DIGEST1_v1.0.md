MINI DIGEST

Scope:

Strict log of all files ingested so far

Their exact filesystem paths (as given by you)

Their layer/relevance category — not analysis, just categorical placement

Markdown format

No canonical judgements yet

No hierarchy modelling yet

After the log, I will generate a Thread Starter that carries this state forward cleanly.
