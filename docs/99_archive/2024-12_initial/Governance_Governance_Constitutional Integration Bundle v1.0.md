Constitutional Integration Bundle v1.0

LifeOS — Structural Governance Amendments (12-Part Integration)

0. Purpose

This bundle integrates the twelve new governance structures required to safely support:

Reflective modification

Judiciary review

Constitutional evolution

Capability expansion

Identity continuity

Long-run recursive self-improvement

Each amendment is fully independent, but all interoperable.
This bundle updates the constitutional corpus with formal rules, definitions, and procedural structures without altering the original hierarchy:

Constitution

Alignment Layer

COO Runtime Spec

Implementation Packet

1. Judiciary Layer v1.0
1.1 Definition

The Judiciary is the constitutional review mechanism for all gated transitions (self-modification, governance modification, Builder proposals, capability extensions).

1.2 Structure

Panel size: 3

Each judge independent (no cross-pollination)

Deterministic quorum:

3–0 → APPROVED

2–1 → REVISE

1–2 → REJECT

0–3 → REJECT

1.3 Jurisdiction

Judiciary reviews:

All modifications to Runtime, Builder, Hub

All constitutional interpretations

All governance-affecting changes

All GSIP-generated proposals

All proposals affecting identity, version, or semantics

1.4 Prohibitions

Judges cannot:

Initiate change

Generate proposals

Modify constitution

Create new authority categories

2. Governance Specification & Integration Protocol (GSIP) v1.0
2.1 Purpose

GSIP standardises how any component of LifeOS:

Receives proposals

Generates modification packets

Routes them into Judiciary

Applies governed changes

Logs all stages

2.2 Requirements

Every proposal must include:

Target component

Rationale

Impact on invariants

Compatibility analysis

Verification steps

Rollback plan

Consequences of failure

2.3 Enforcement

Judiciary may not review a proposal that lacks a GSIP-conformant packet.
Runtime may not apply a change lacking Judiciary approval.

3. Bounds on Reflective Operations v1.0
3.1 Mission-Boundedness

All reflective operations must:

Occur inside an explicit mission

Declare scope, purpose, and bounds

Terminate deterministically

3.2 No Implicit Reflection

Reflective actions may not occur:

As side effects

As background operations

Due to environmental triggers

3.3 Explicit Reflection Permission

Any reflective mission must explicitly state:

“This mission performs Reflective Operations”

Scope of allowed self-inspection

Scope of allowed self-modification

4. Constitutional Amendment Path v1.0
4.1 Constitutional Amendment

Amendment requires:

Proposal submitted through GSIP

Judiciary review

CEO confirmation

Audit ledger entry

New epoch boundary established if structural meaning changes

4.2 Amendment Limits

Amendments may not:

Create unbounded autonomous behaviours

Abolish Judiciary without replacement

Remove CEO supremacy

Introduce silent inference

5. Constitutional Escape Hatch v1.0
5.1 Emergency Authority

CEO may declare:
“Constitutional Emergency — Direct Intervention Required.”

This allows:

Suspension of Judiciary

Direct state correction

Temporary bypass of review

5.2 Constraints

Emergency actions must:

Be fully logged

Be followed by Judiciary reconstruction

Trigger identity review

5.3 Use Case

Used only when:

Judiciary is corrupted or non-functional

Version manifest mismatches actual state

Identity rupture is imminent

6. Governance Load Balancer v1.0
6.1 Purpose

Ensures Judiciary and GSIP operations always have deterministic execution capacity.

6.2 Rules

Governance operations have priority over non-governance missions

Predefined capacity reserve (configurable)

Rate limiting applied to non-governance missions

Over-capacity triggers “governance protection mode”

This prevents deadlock or governance starvation

7. Governance Drift Monitor v1.0
7.1 Purpose

Detects drift across:

Constitutional interpretation

Judiciary decisions

Precedent meaning

Capability/governance ratio

User intent transmission

7.2 Evaluates

Precedent chain stability

Interpretive semantics

Version transitions

GSIP packet quality stability

Identity continuity signal

7.3 Drift Escalation

Subtle drift → Judiciary flag

Moderate drift → Judiciary review of precedents

Critical drift → CEO review + possible Epoch shift

8. Precedent Lifecycle Rules v1.0
8.1 Creation

A precedent is created only when:

Judiciary makes an interpretation

Interpretation affects future decision logic

Interpretation is formally logged

8.2 Binding

Precedent binds when:

It is logged

Judiciary did not mark it “case-specific only”

8.3 Decay

Precedent decays if:

Marked low-impact

Not referenced for long period

Superseded by constitutional amendment

8.4 Retirement

Judiciary may retire precedents if:

Conflicting

Obsolete

Semantically drifted

Retired precedents remain immutable historical records.

9. Capability–Governance Scaling Rule v1.0
9.1 Scaling Mandate

As capabilities increase, governance sophistication MUST increase proportionally.

9.2 Enforcement

At each capability threshold:

Judiciary complexity must scale

Verification rigor must strengthen

GSIP specification detail must expand

9.3 Ratchets

Capability gain triggers governance ratchet:

Stronger review

More precise invariants

Enhanced drift detection

Governance cannot be weakened by capability expansion.

10. System Stratification Model v1.0
10.1 Definition

LifeOS is stratified into layers:

Operational Runtime (executes missions)

Reflective Runtime (inspects and generates proposals)

Judiciary (governs and interprets)

Advisory Council (non-binding analysis, ideas, strategy)

10.2 Separation

No layer may execute the functions of:

A higher layer

A layer two levels above or below

Operational cannot interpret constitution.
Judiciary cannot propose improvements.
Advisory cannot approve modifications.

11. Version Epoch Rules v1.0
11.1 Epoch Definition

An epoch is a version interval with stable:

Governance semantics

Precedent interpretation

Constitution meaning

Component compatibility

11.2 Epoch Boundary Triggers

Epoch changes occur when:

Constitution meaning shifts

Judiciary structure changes

Identity continuity rules change

Major component semantics change

11.3 Backward Rules

Earlier epochs may not impose rules forward.
Forward epochs may selectively uplift backward precedents.

12. Identity Continuity Rules v1.0
12.1 Identity Definition

LifeOS remains the same system only if:

Every transition originates from a governed, constitutional lineage

Audit ledger reconstructs all governed transitions

Version manifest matches system state

12.2 Identity Break

Identity breaks if:

Governance bypassed

Judiciary corrupted

Audit ledger corrupted

Version manifest desynchronizes

Unbounded or missionless execution occurs

External uncontrolled code injected

12.3 Recovery

Hard freeze

CEO emergency correction

Rollback to last identity-preserving checkpoint

Judiciary reconstruction

Manifest reconciliation
