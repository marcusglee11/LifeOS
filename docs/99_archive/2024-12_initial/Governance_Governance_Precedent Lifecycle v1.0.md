Precedent Lifecycle v1.0 — Integration Packet
1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines how judicial precedent is:

created

classified

bound

modified

superseded

pruned

re-authorised

protected from semantic drift

Precedent governs how the Judiciary interprets constitutional clauses and GSIP requirements across time. It is interpretive, not constitutional, and therefore:

may guide decisions

must not override explicit constitutional text

cannot apply outside its declared scope

is amendable or reversible through the mechanisms defined herein

2. Precedent Ontology
2.1 Precedent Types

Precedents are divided into three classes:

Binding Precedent (BP)
Applies to all future materially identical cases.
Requires explicit designation.

Persuasive Precedent (PP)
Guides future cases but is not mandatory.

Exceptional Precedent (EP)
Applies only to the specific context in which it was created.
Cannot be used to generalise; exists to log reasoning in corner cases.

2.2 Precedent Components

Every precedent must include:

Case identifier

Precedent type (BP/PP/EP)

Issue addressed

Interpretation applied

Reasoning narrative

Bound constitutional/GSIP clauses

Applicability conditions

Limitations

Supersession conditions

3. Precedent Creation Rules
3.1 When a Precedent Is Created

A precedent must be recorded when:

A Judiciary decision interprets the constitution or GSIP clauses in a way not explicitly stated.

A conflict between existing precedents is resolved.

A new category of decision sits between existing interpretive boundaries.

Ambiguous text is clarified.

Context-specific exceptions are created.

3.2 How Precedent Type Is Assigned

BP only if:

The issue is constitutional or core-governance.

The reasoning is fully generalisable.

No Judiciary panel member dissented.

PP if:

Interpretation is useful but not universally applicable.

The case contains contextual boundaries.

EP if:

Highly specific contextual constraints exist.

A temporary workaround is required.

A GSIP “High-Risk Exception” applies.

4. Precedent Hierarchy and Conflict Resolution
4.1 Hierarchy

Constitution

GSIP

Binding precedent

Persuasive precedent

Exceptional precedent

4.2 Conflict Rules

Constitutional text always overrides precedent.

GSIP text overrides precedent unless constitutionally prohibited.

BP overrides PP and EP.

PP overrides EP.

Two BP conflicts trigger mandatory consolidation (see below).

4.3 Consolidation Requirements

If two BPs conflict:

The Judiciary must generate a Consolidated Precedent Record (CPR):

Identifies the conflict

Reconciles interpretations

Establishes a single unified rule

CPR replaces both prior BPs.

5. Precedent Drift Controls
5.1 Drift Categories

Drift occurs when:

Precedent is applied outside its intended scope.

Series of PP decisions extend a concept beyond original meaning.

Language interpretation shifts over time.

New capabilities introduce contexts not foreseen in original cases.

5.2 Drift Detection

The Judiciary must provide:

A drift assessment for each decision:

Does the applied interpretation extend scope?

Does it weaken or strengthen the original meaning?

Drift event logging:

“Minor drift” (clarificatory)

“Moderate drift” (range-extension)

“Major drift” (semantic boundary change → triggers review)

5.3 Drift Boundaries

A precedent cannot:

invert meaning of constitutional text

narrow constitutional rights or constraints beyond plain language

expand Judiciary authority beyond its mandate

reinterpret “CEO supremacy”, “determinism”, “audit completeness”, or “mission-bound execution”

Any such attempt is automatically invalid.

6. Precedent Pruning & Retirement
6.1 Age-Based Review

Every precedent must undergo scheduled review at:

12 months (mandatory)

24 months (mandatory)

36 months (sunset unless re-authorised)

6.2 Review Outcomes

A precedent may be:

Re-authorised (no changes)

Revised (replaced with updated precedent)

Consolidated (merged into a broader rule)

Retired (removed; referenced as historical record only)

6.3 Automatic Retirement Conditions

A precedent must be retired if:

Underlying constitutional or GSIP clauses are amended.

Capability context has substantively changed (new component class, new operational domain).

It conflicts with a new BP.

The system must maintain historical records but mark the rule as retired and non-applicable.

7. Precedent Re-Authorisation Protocol
7.1 Required Checks

Each precedent must be evaluated for:

Constitutional consistency

GSIP alignment

Judiciary authority scope

Applicability to current system capability

Drift accumulation

Conflict with newer precedents

7.2 Re-Authorisation Decision

Requires:

At least one Judiciary member validating constitutional compliance

Consensus or majority (per the established model)

CEO notified (informational, not approval)

7.3 Re-Authorisation Audit Entry

Each re-authorisation creates:

Version increment

Reason for re-authorisation

Change/no-change justification

8. Usage Boundaries
8.1 Cannot Create New Powers

Precedent cannot:

introduce new Judiciary authority

extend scope of capabilities

modify constitutional text

create new GSIP categories

create new mission classes

8.2 Cannot Silently Replace Text

Interpretation must:

cite the clause interpreted

justify why textual meaning is insufficient

provide tests for applicability

8.3 Cannot Block Constitutional Operations

Precedent must not prevent operations that the constitution expressly permits.

9. Amendment of Precedent Lifecycle

This lifecycle is amendable only through:

Judiciary GSIP

CEO-reviewed amendment

Constitutional compliance verification

Amendments must be logged, versioned, and declared system-wide.

Precedent Lifecycle v1.0 — Summary Principles

Interpretation must not become legislation.

Drift is tracked, surfaced, and corrected early.

Binding precedent must be rare, stable, and rigorously justified.

Exceptional precedent prevents corner-case blowouts but never generalises.

Time limits prevent silent ossification.

Consolidation ensures coherence.

Identity continuity across versions depends on consistent interpretation.
