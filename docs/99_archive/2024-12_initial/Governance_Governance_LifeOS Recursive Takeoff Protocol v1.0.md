LifeOS Recursive Takeoff Protocol v1.0

Location: LifeOS/docs/Governance/
Purpose: Define the exact, deterministic sequence for the first governed recursive improvement cycle.
Outcome: System generates → reviews → approves → deploys its first governed improvement.

Phase 1 — Pre-Takeoff Freeze

Freeze Runtime V1.0 state

Capture Version Manifest snapshot

Verify audit completeness

Judiciary confirms constitutional readiness

CEO certifies Checklist v1.0 as COMPLETE

Output: Takeoff_State_Snapshot_0.json

Phase 2 — Council V1 Materialization

Hub triggers Builder Mode mission: "Generate Council V1"

Builder produces:

Council Role Prompts

Reviewer Templates

Advisory Panel Charter

Council Protocol Files

Judiciary evaluates all artefacts as a Gated Recursion Event

CEO conducts manual audit (first and only time)

Judiciary approves activation

Output: Council_V1_Implementation.zip

Phase 3 — Judiciary-Council Link Activation

Judiciary links Council into advisory flow

Council cannot modify anything

Council can request information, raise flags, suggest improvements

Hub routes advisory outputs to CEO and Judiciary

Judiciary confirms Council is deterministic (no “initiative”, no implicit optimization)

Output: Governance_Surface_v1.0_Online

Phase 4 — First Improvement Proposal (Runtime V1.1)

CEO issues mission: "Propose first self-improvement"

Builder Mode generates V1.1 candidate

Builder produces:

Spec

Implementation

Test suite delta

Rationale

Safety & Governance Impact Report

Council reviews from advisory standpoint

Judiciary reviews from governance standpoint

Judiciary issues unified verdict (pass / reject / revise)

Output: Judiciary_Verdict_0001.yaml

Phase 5 — Governed Application of V1.1

If Approved:

Hub executes deterministic apply-script

Runtime upgraded to V1.1

Version Manifest incremented

Audit log updated

Full replay test executes

Judiciary verifies audit chain correctness

CEO confirms strategic alignment

If Rejected:

Builder revises

Process repeats

Output: Runtime_V1.1_Activation_Record.json

Phase 6 — Post-Takeoff Recursion Loop

After the first successful cycle:

Recursion loop becomes active

Builder → Judiciary → Runtime loop becomes standard flow

Hub orchestrates multi-step improvements deterministically

Council remains advisory until future phases

Judiciary maintains constitutional boundaries

CEO retains supremacy over strategy but no longer performs operational oversight

Output: LifeOS_RecursiveEngine_v1.0_Enabled

Phase 7 — Takeoff Certification

CEO reviews takeoff cycle summary

Judiciary certifies full compliance

Constitution and Alignment Layer updated with Takeoff Record

LifeOS enters Recursive Operational State

Output: Takeoff_Certified.yaml

End of Artefact: LifeOS Recursive Takeoff Protocol v1.0
