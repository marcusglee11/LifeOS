# BACKLOG (prune aggressively; target ≤ 40 items)

## Workflow Hook

**"Done means" checklist:**

- [ ] Update BACKLOG item status + evidence pointer (commit/packet)
- [ ] Update `LIFEOS_STATE.md` (Current Focus/Blockers/Recent Wins)
- [ ] Refresh baseline pack pointer + sha (`artifacts/packets/status/Repo_Autonomy_Status_Pack__Main.zip`)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08

## Now (ready soon; not in WIP yet)

### P0 (Critical)

- [ ] **Install OpenClaw COO on WSL2** — DoD: OpenClaw installed, workspace configured, can read repo and update state docs — Owner: CEO — Context: The only genuine gap blocking autonomous build loop

### P1 (High)

- [ ] **E2E Loop Test: Real task through full pipeline** — DoD: One task completes select→design→build→review→steward autonomously — Owner: antigravity/COO — Context: All code components exist, needs integration verification
- [ ] **Ledger Hash Chain (Trusted Builder P1)** — DoD: Tamper-proof linking of bypass records — Owner: antigravity — Context: Deferred from Trusted Builder v1.1 Ratification
- [ ] **Bypass Monitoring (Trusted Builder P1)** — DoD: Alerting on high bypass utilization — Owner: antigravity — Context: Deferred from Trusted Builder v1.1 Ratification
- [ ] **Semantic Guardrails (Trusted Builder P1)** — DoD: Heuristics for meaningful changes — Owner: antigravity — Context: Deferred from Trusted Builder v1.1 Ratification
- [ ] **Fix test_steward_runner.py (25/27 failing)** — DoD: Tests pass or are properly restructured — Owner: antigravity — Context: Import/fixture issues, not code bugs
- [ ] **Fix test_e2e_smoke_timeout.py (import error)** — DoD: run_with_timeout import fixed or test updated — Owner: antigravity
- [ ] **Finalize Emergency_Declaration_Protocol v1.0** — DoD: Markers removed — Owner: antigravity
- [ ] **Finalize Intent_Routing_Rule v1.0** — DoD: Markers removed — Owner: antigravity
- [ ] **Finalize Test_Protocol v2.0** — DoD: Markers removed — Owner: antigravity
- [ ] **Finalize Tier_Definition_Spec v1.1** — DoD: Markers removed — Owner: antigravity
- [ ] **Finalize ARTEFACT_INDEX_SCHEMA v1.0** — DoD: Markers removed — Owner: antigravity
- [ ] **Finalize QUICKSTART v1.0** — DoD: Context scan pass complete — Owner: antigravity

## Next (valuable, but not imminent)

- [ ] **Configure GCP Employee instance** — Context: Hardened OpenClaw config, dedicated accounts, Tailscale
- [ ] **Revenue Track: LinkedIn daily posts** — Context: COO drafts, CEO reviews. Seed: "What autonomous AI agents actually cost to run"
- [ ] **Revenue Track: B5 Governance Guide** — Context: 19,500 lines of real code + 1,440 tests backing the content
- [ ] **Mission Type Extensions** — Why Next: Add new mission types based on backlog needs
- [ ] **Tech Debt: Rehabilitate Legacy Git Workflow Tests** — Context: Quarantined to archive_legacy_r6x due to missing run_cmd mock. Rehabilitate or remove.

## Later (not actionable / unclear / exploratory)

- [ ] **Fuel track exploration** — Why Later: Not blocking Core; future consideration per roadmap
- [ ] **Productisation of Tier-1/Tier-2 engine** — Why Later: Depends on Core stabilisation
