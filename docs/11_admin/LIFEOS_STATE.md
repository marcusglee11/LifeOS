## ⚠️ System Blockers (Top 3)

1. **Model reliability for autonomous runs** (P1) — Free OpenCode models (minimax-m2.5, kimi-k2.5, gpt-5-nano) are slow/unreliable; may need paid tier for production autonomy.
2. **OpenCode doc-steward delegate dependency gap** (P1) — `scripts/delegate_to_doc_steward.py` blocked by missing `PyYAML` in current env.
3. **Auto-commit integration gap** (P1) — Spine E2E run completed work but auto-commit failed; manual commit required. Needs investigation (see E2E build summary).
