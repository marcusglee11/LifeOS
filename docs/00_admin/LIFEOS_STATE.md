## Current Focus

**Core Track: Tier-3 Bridge — Reactive Task Layer v0.1 (Spec + Boundaries)**

Tier-2.5 is active. Phase-2 items (F1/F5/F6) are non-blocking hygiene and will be closed in a single batch.

## Active WIP (max 2)

- **[WIP-1]** Core Track — Reactive Task Layer v0.1 (Spec + Boundaries)
- **[WIP-2]** Tier-2.5 Hygiene Batch — close F1/F5/F6 + verify F2 complete (one-pass, timeboxed)

## Blockers
- None

## Open Questions
- None

## Next Actions (top 5–10)

1. Draft Reactive Task Layer v0.1 spec + boundaries (definition-only, no execution)
2. Implement tests for determinism/spec conformance for Reactive v0.1
3. Run Tier-2 test suite (baseline) and lock green before any Tier-3 work continues
4. Execute Tier-2.5 Hygiene Batch (F1/F5/F6; confirm F2 complete) in one pass
5. (Next) Mission Registry v0.1 — only after Reactive v0.1 is pinned

## Context for Next Session

### Core-Track Next Milestones
- Reactive Task Layer v0.1
- Reactive Planner v0.2
- Mission Registry v0.1
- Mission Registry v0.2
- Autonomous Execution Surface v0.1
