# OpenClaw COO Runbook

## Canonical Commands

- OpenClaw operations: `coo openclaw -- <args>`
- Shell/process operations: `coo run -- <command>`

## Receipts (Runtime Default)

Canonical operator path is runtime-only receipts (no repo writes by default):

- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/receipts/<UTC_TS>/Receipt_Bundle_OpenClaw.md`
- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/receipts/<UTC_TS>/receipt_manifest.json`
- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/receipts/<UTC_TS>/openclaw_run_ledger_entry.jsonl`
- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/ledger/openclaw_run_ledger.jsonl`

If `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` is not writable, scripts fall back to `/tmp/openclaw-runtime/...`.

Run default mode:

```bash
runtime/tools/openclaw_receipts_bundle.sh
```

Optional explicit repo export (copy-only):

```bash
runtime/tools/openclaw_receipts_bundle.sh --export-repo
```

Export path:

- `artifacts/evidence/openclaw/receipts/Receipt_Bundle_OpenClaw_<UTC_TS>.md`

Export is optional and should only be used when a repo-local evidence copy is required.

## Verify Surface

Run full verify flow (security/model/sandbox/gateway checks + receipt generation + ledger append + leak scan):

```bash
runtime/tools/openclaw_verify_surface.sh
```

Expected output:

- `PASS runtime_receipt=<path> ledger_path=<path>`
- or `FAIL runtime_receipt=<path> ledger_path=<path>`

## Safety Invariants

- Default receipt generation must not write to repo paths.
- Ledger and receipts must remain redacted-safe.
- Leak scan must pass for runtime receipt + runtime ledger entry.
